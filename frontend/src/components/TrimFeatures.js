                The drivers of Hunt Valley should be excited to know 
                about all the trim packages that the RAV4 offers. There 
                are 10 different trims to choose from, with even the 
                base package full of features. When factoring in the 
                hybrid models, it's easy to see that Toyota offers a 
                choice for every driver.
